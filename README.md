# Automated Email Sender Using Python

# Overview
This Python script allows you to automate the process of sending emails using the SMTP protocol via Gmail. It's a simple example of sending emails with a specified subject and body to one or more recipients.

# Prerequisites
Python installed on your machine
1. The `smtplib` library is included in Python by default, so no additional installation is needed.
1. A Gmail account
2. Allow "Less secure apps" in your Gmail settings (or use an "App Password" if two-factor authentication is enabled)

# Important Note
Be cautious with your email and password; it's a good practice to use an App Password if you have two-factor authentication enabled.
